# Lap Tracker  

This app is my first JavaScript project outside of tutorials and courses. My inspiration was to create something simple that would track how many laps I would swim each day and log it. My goals are to explore ways to analyse and track this data, give updates about progress etc.

### TO DO's 

1. Make delete button function to remove each row and not the bottom rows 
2. Add a row to the bottom of the table to calculate data such as average laps 
3. Delete data from LS when delete is clicked
